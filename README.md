# Medical-Premium-EDA-and-Logistic-Regression

This is a Internshala assignment given to me for the post of Data Analyst.
The given data set contains a user's medical history in the form of whether they have a specific condition or not, their age, height, weight, etc along with the premium they have to pay in INR for insurance. Perform an exploratory data analysis to determine what factors play an important role in determining the premium of the user.
